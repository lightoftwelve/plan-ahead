# Plan Ahead

## Overview
"Plan Ahead" is a simple yet effective daily planner. Designed for standard business hours (9:00 am to 5:00 pm), this planner allows users to manage their time efficiently by adding events to each time block of the day. The planner features color-coded time blocks representing past, present, and future events. Any event added to the planner is saved in local storage, ensuring your plans persist even when the page is refreshed.

## Features
- Current day displayed at the top of the calendar.
- Time blocks for standard business hours (9:00 am to 5:00 pm).
- Color-coded time blocks to indicate whether they are in the past, present, or future.
- Ability to add events to time blocks.
- Events are saved in local storage.
- Events persist after a page refresh.
- Ability to erase events with a simple click of the refresh button.

## Usage Guide
Simply scroll down to view the time blocks. Click on a time block to add an event, and click the save button to store it. Time blocks are color-coded to indicate whether they're in the past, present, or future. To erase an event, press the refresh button beside the hour you would like to erase.
